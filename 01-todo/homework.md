# Introduction to AI-Assisted Development

In this homework, we'll build an application with AI.

You can use any tool you want: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Cursor, etc.

We will build a TODO application in Django.

You will only need Python to get started. You don't need to know Python or Django for that.


## Question 1: Install Django

We want to install Django. Ask AI to help you with that.
What's the command you used for that?

There could be multiple ways to do it. Put the one that AI suggested in the homework form.
- pip3 install django
- python3 -m django --version
- django-admin

## Question 2: Project and App

Now we need to create a project and an app for that.

Follow the instructions from AI to do it. At some point, you will need to include the app you created in the project.

What's the file you need to edit for that?

- `settings.py` <--- this one
- `manage.py` <-- superuser
- `urls.py`
- `wsgi.py`

models
views
templates
base.html
todo_list template
register in admin
migrations
url routing


## Question 3: Django Models

Let's now proceed to creating models - the mapping from python objects to a relational database.

For the TODO app, which models do we need? Implement them.
* Title (required)
* Description (optional)
* Completed status
* Created and updated timestamps
* Automatic ordering by creation date

What's the next step you need to take?

Create a superuser for admin access:
Run the development server:
Access the application:



- Run the application
- Add the models to the admin panel
- Run migrations
- Create a makefile

## Question 4. Templates

Let's finish it later

## Homework URL

Commit your code to GitHub. You can create a repository for this course. Within the repository, create a folder, e.g. "01-todo", where you put the code.

Use the link to this folder in the homework submission form.


## Tip

You can copy-paste the homework description into the AI system of your choice. But make sure you understand (and follow) all the steps in the response.
