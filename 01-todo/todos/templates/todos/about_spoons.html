        You may have noticed the spoon pattern background throughout this site.
        Here's the story behind it...
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        <strong>The Spoon Theory</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Coined by Christine Miserandino to explain her experience living with a chronic illness,
        "Spoon Theory" is a metaphor used to describe the amount
        of mental or physical energy a person has available for daily activities.
        Each spoon represents a unit of energy, and when you're out of spoons, you're out of energy.

    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
        In the context of a TODO app, it's a reminder that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every task requires physical, mental, and/or emotional energy (spoons)</li>
        <li>We all have limited resources each day</li>
        <li>It's important to prioritize what matters most</li>
        <li>Taking care of yourself is essential</li>
    </ul>
