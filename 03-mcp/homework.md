# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

In this homework, we will build our own MCP server - a clone of Context7.

For that, we will need:

- Select a GitHub repo with documentation
- Download the data from it
- Make it searchable

Let's start!


## Question 1: Create a New Project

Create a new project. We will use `uv` for dependency management. Install it if you don't have it:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Create a directory and initialize an empty project there:

```bash
uv init
```

Install fastmcp:

```bash
uv add fastmcp
```


In `uv.lock`, what's the first hash in the `wheels` section of `fastmcp`? Include the entire string without quotes.
    { url = "https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/78/b6/6307fbef88d9b5ee7421e68d78a9f162e0da4900bc5f5793f6d3d0e34fb8/annotated_types-0.7.0-py3-none-any.whl", hash = "sha256:1f02e8b43a8fbbc3f3e0d4f0f4bfc8131bcb4eebe8849b8e5c773f3a1c582a53", size = 13643, upload-time = "2024-05-20T21:33:24.1Z" },

## Question 2: FastMCP Transport

Now let's update the main file.

Use the starter code from [their docs](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp):

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Demo 🚀")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers"""
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```


Run the server.

You'll see the welcome screen. What's the transport?

* STDIO <-----
* HTTP
* HTTPS
* SSE


## Question 3: Scrape Web Tool

Now let's create a tool for downloading content of any web page.

We'll use Jina reader for that.

To get content of any page in markdown, you simply need to add `r.jina.ai` in front of the address. For example: `https://r.jina.ai/https://datatalks.club`

Ask your AI assistant to create a tool based on this. You can ask it to use the `requests` library.

I also recommend testing it. I used a prompt like that:

```
Create a file `test.py` which invokes this function to test that it works well
```

Test it to retrieve the content of `https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch`. How many characters does it return?


* 1184
* 9184
* 19184
* 29184 <---this one

Select the closest answer if you don't get the exact match.


## Question 4: Integrate the Tool

Integrate the MCP tool into your AI assistant.

The command for running the MCP server is this:

```bash
uv --directory ~/path/to/homework run python main.py
```

(or `C:/Users/username/path/to/homework` if you're on Windows)

Replace the directory with the full path to this project

Ask it the following:

```
Count how many times the word "data" appears on https://datatalks.club/
Use available MCP tools for that
```

What's the answer?

* 61 <----
* 111
* 161
* 261

Select the closest answer if you don't get the exact match.


## Question 5: Implement Search (2 points)

Now ask the agent to:

* Download https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip. Don't download it if it's already downloaded
* Iterate over all zip files but read only md and mdx ones
* Remove the first part of the path in the filename. So "fastmcp-main/docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx" becomes "docs/getting-started/welcome.mdx"
* Index these files with minsearch. Put the text content in "content" field and filename in "filename"
* Use https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/minsearch to learn how to use minsearch
* Create a search function that retrieves 5 most relevant documents from the index
* Create search.py and test the implementation there

What's the first file returned that you get with the query "demo"?

* README.md
* docs/servers/context.mdx
* examples/testing_demo/README.md <-----
* docs/python-sdk/fastmcp-settings.mdx


## Question 6: Search Tool (ungraded)

Now you can ask your assistant to implement it as a tool in main.py - and voila, you have a documentation search engine in your AI assistant!


## Homework URL

Commit your code to GitHub. You can create a repository for this course. Within the repository, create a folder, e.g. "03-mcp", where you put the code.

Use the link to this folder in the homework submission form.


## Tip

You can copy-paste the homework description into the AI system of your choice. But make sure you understand (and follow) all the steps in the response.

## Learning in Public

We encourage everyone to share what they learned. This is called "learning in public".

Don't worry about being perfect. Everyone starts somewhere, and people love following genuine learning journeys!
